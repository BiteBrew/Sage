# 🌿 Sage: Wisdom in Every Line of Code

## 🔮 About
Sage is not just a project; it's a journey into the realm of intelligent coding. Like its namesake, Sage aims to bring wisdom and clarity to your development process.

- **Visual Insights**: Capture your code's essence faster than you can say "cheese"! (`capture.png`)
